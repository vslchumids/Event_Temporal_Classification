John Chiang, Vincent Chu

File List:

1) nlp_cnn.py	- Define the NLPCNN class which contains all necessary ops for the NLP CNN model used to
   predict temporal states of annotated data from the EventStatus corpus.
   Part of the code adopted and modified from text_cnn.py of Danny Britz's cnn-text-classification-tf Github page

2) segment.py	- Straight from W266 Week 2 Materials, Used for preliminary EDA on the EventStatus corpus 

3) societal_data_processor.py	- Define helper functions and processing and preparation of the annotated data from the 
   EventStatus corpus.
   Includes helper functions from data_helpers.py of Danny Britz's cnn-text-classification-tf Github page
